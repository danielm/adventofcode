# AdventOfCode

My AdventOfCode üéÑ Solutions ‚≠ê . Made in Rust ü¶Ä

## Why u do dis?

- Learning Rust, almost like from scatch 
- Keep writing a little Rust everyday
- No AOC helpers / dependencies (crates) or such. *Yes I also need to learn to to read and parse files and all that fun stuff.*
- Will try to make 1 solution that covers both parts: That means that during part2, i'm going to refactor.
- The idea is to complete all the challenges in my freetime before the 2022 edition starts.
- I will code like: `It's xmas eve, got a call from work telling everything is on fire and need to push the fix using the hackiest way asap` 
- Gonna write as much Rust code as possible; that means: For something like Regex, i'm gonna learn how to use them in rust, but after that if possible, i'm going to try to go arround that unless the solution is way more complicated... Like: I'm not gonna code the sha256 algorithm lol
