# AdventOfCode

My AdventOfCode 🎄 Solutions ⭐ . Made in Rust 🦀

## Why u do dis?

- Learning Rust, almost like from scatch 
- Keep writing a little Rust everyday
- No AOC helpers / dependencies (crates) or such. *Yes I also need to learn to to read and parse files and all that fun stuff.*
- Will try to make 1 solution that covers both parts: That means that during part2, i'm going to refactor.
- The idea is to complete all the challenges in my freetime before the 2022 edition starts.
